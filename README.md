> It is good practice to use virutal envirionments when using python packages to maintain dependencies and manage the packages used for a project independently. so first create a virtual envirionment using your desired virtual environment module e.g. 
- using virtualenv
- 
  
`virtualenv bs4.env`

`pip install bs4`

The above installs Beautifulsoup package to be used in scrapping.

`pip install requests`

This install the requests library to request data from the webpages
